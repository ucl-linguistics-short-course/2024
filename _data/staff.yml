      bio: I am a PhD student specializing in the morphosyntax of Arabic tense and aspect. I also delve into phonology (autosegmental morphophonology) and the formal semantics of tense and aspect in order to account for modern Arabic dialects and how they lexicalize their VPs and auxiliaries.

      bio: Fourth-year PhD student with an interest in psycholinguistics and neurolinguistics, particularly in the predictive mechanisms in real-time language comprehension, and the interaction between language processing and (domain-general) cognitive processes (e.g., cognitive control, memory, attention).

      bio: Yolanda García-Lorenzo is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of the Basque Country/UCL. Her PhD in Linguistics explored the role of Theory of Mind in irony comprehension. Currently, her research delves into the cognitive abilities underlying pragmatic skills, with a particular focus on metarepresentational abilities in the understanding of irony and lies from a developmental perspective.

      bio: Tim Jantarungsee is a PhD student specialising in formal semantics and endangered language documentation. His research interests include the semantics of modal “ability” expressions, cross-lingusitic lexical semantics of “eating” predicates, fieldwork methodology, language policy and decolonising linguistics, working with minoritised languages in East and South-East Asia.

      bio: Teru Konishi is a PhD student at UCL specialising in Linguistics (Pragmatics). His research focuses on the intersections between literature and linguistics, and his current doctoral work investigates the pragmatic theories that enable humans to comprehend, understand and appreciate allegory. His other academic interests include poems and poetic effects, philosophy of language, and art and communication.

      bio: Erying Qin works on experimental pragmatics, which aims to use methodologies drawn from the experimental psychology to investigate current theories of semantics and pragmatics for human language. Her doctoral work focuses on scalar inferences for different scalar words, particularly for paucal quantifiers.
